The Campus Recruitment EDA was a fun little side project to test out some plot styles that have become a norm for me since then. Additionally, I was genuinely interested in the data and how different stages of academic success translate into job potential and salary. Another side goal for me was to create a small replicable one-way ANOVA function that I could use in the future. The dataset proved to be excellent for this endeavour as the data had little to no missing values.
